# Task 4: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

## Dataset
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** (from sklearn)

## Objective
Build a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

## Steps
- Loaded and standardized the data.
- Split into train/test sets.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC.
- Tuned threshold and explained sigmoid activation.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Evaluation
- ROC AUC Score: 0.99 (approx)
