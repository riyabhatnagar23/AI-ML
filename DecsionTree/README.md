# Decision Tree & Random Forest - Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Trained a Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier to predict heart disease presence.

## 📂 Steps
1. Loaded and cleaned dataset.
2. Trained Decision Tree with max depth control.
3. Visualized tree structure.
4. Compared accuracy between Decision Tree & Random Forest.
5. Analyzed overfitting and performed cross-validation.
6. Visualized feature importances.

## 🛠 Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Graphviz

## 📊 Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.9473684210526315
- Random Forest Accuracy: 0.9649122807017544
- Random Forest performed better and avoided overfitting.
